  This function takes a pointer p to an array of n bytes.  The address
  to which p points is expected to be aligned on a N = sizeof (char*)
  boundary. The minimum value of n expected is 2 * S, where S >= N.
  The buffer is split into blocks of size S and the blocks are linked
  in a LIFO fashion (stack). The address of the next block is recorded
  in the first N bytes of the block. The block sizes S are expected to
  be at least the size of a pointer.

  returns a pointer to the top of the stack.
